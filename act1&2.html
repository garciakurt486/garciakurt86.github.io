<h1><b><u>Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go</u></b></h1>
<h4><i>Wham!</i></h4>

<p><font color= black> <i>
You put the boom boom into my heart <br>
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts <br>
Jitterbug into my brain (yeah, yeah)<br>
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same </p>

<p>But something's buggin' me<i>
Something ain't right <br>
My best friend told me what you did last night <br>
Left me sleeping in my bed <br>
I was dreaming <br>
But I should've been with you instead </p>

<p>Wake me up before you go-go <i><br>
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo <br>
Wake me up before you go-go <br>
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high </p>

<p>Wake me up before you go-go <i><br>
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo <br>
Wake me up before you go-go <br>
Take me dancing tonight <br>
I wanna hit that high <br>
Yeah, yeah </p>
